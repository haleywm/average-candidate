# Average Candidate

*The average face and description of every candidate for different parties.*

The goal of this project is to experiment with Markov chains and web scraping, in order to scrape information to generate a joke candidate page using the combined information of every candidate.

I hope to be able to use a decent level of automation in this, so that I can easily generate pages using candidates within certain states, across the country, or potentially within regions depending on the complexity.

I will be primarily targetting the Australian Liberal, Labor, and Greens parties as they are the biggest parties, however I may expand this depending on how the complexity works out to be.
